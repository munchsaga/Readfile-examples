For line in f:
	print (line)
this will print all the lines line by line

For line in f:
	print(line)
	f.readline()
} this will print every second line
For line in f reads the first line, assigns it to the line variable, 
When you print line, the first line gets printed out
The next lien in the code is f.readline, here, f.readline also reads the current line, so since you already read the first line, you will now read the second line and you donâ€™t do anything with it, because yo9u don't print it
So now you go back to the top, and have for line in f: and you are at the third line now, you print it with print(line), and read the fourth line without printing it, so you only print every other line.

print(f.readlines()) [0])
}You only print the first line
you are reading the file at index 0 and printing it

line = f.readline()
For line in f:
	print (line)
} prints every line except for the first 
line gets assigned the very first line in the file
after this we have a for loop, and the food loop is also using line as a variable, so the line that we just assigned at the very beginning gets override, and since readline moves the cursor over, the for loop will begin on the second line
